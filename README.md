# Caesar Cipher - Java

Hi, and Welcome to my Console User Interface Caesar Cipher!

My Caesar Cipher will be able to take in any letter, word,
phrase, sentence, paragraph, etc., and encode it,
with a user given shift key value, or decode it with either 
a given shift key value or provide the user with a list
of all possible decryption outputs, allowing the user to
decide which output they desire to get. In addition, the 
time taken for the algorithm to run is also displayed to
the user.
   
I hope you find this application useful, or at the very
least interesting!

**Cheers,**
