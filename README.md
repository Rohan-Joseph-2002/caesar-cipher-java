# Caesar Cipher - Java

Hi, and Welcome to my Console User Interface Caesar Cipher!

My Caesar Cipher will be able to take in any letter, word,
phrase, sentence, paragraph, etc., and encode it,
with a user given shift key value, or decode it with either 
a given shift key value or provide the user with a list
of all possible decryption outputs, allowing the user to
decide which output they desire to get.

There are two iterations of the algorithm that are present
in this project.

1. The first, uses a brute force technique (Alg1).
2. The second, implements the use of a hashmap, in order
to improve the efficiency of the Cipher algorithm (Alg2).
   
I hope you find this application useful, or at the very
least interesting!

**Cheers,**
